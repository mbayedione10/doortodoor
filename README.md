====================
Door To Door
====================

This is DoorToDoor App
we will build Delivery Application using Python 3 and Django
There will be three sides to this application and users must be connected to use it:
1- Customer can add product and view his Dashboard
2- Delivery man views today's product and modify status "doing", "done", "return"
3- Admin can add new users, use like a customer or delivery man, have all dashboard and manage

## How do I get set up? ##

####1. Create a python environment####

The environement setup process depends on your system. Do some research to find out how to do it on OS. For MAC you can use the following commands
pip install virtualenv
```
Create virtual environment
python -m virtualenv myenv

Active this env
Mac: source myenv/bin/activate
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate.bat

```

####2. Clone the repo and move to the project folder####
```
git clone *repo_url*
cd dkrexpress

```

####3. Install required python packages####
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

####4. Apply database migrations####
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```


####5. Run the app####
```
./manage.py runserver

```
The api should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Troubleshooting ##
If there is any problem during the installation of the python package, just install each them one by one using `pip install` *package_name*. 
The most important packages are `django`, `django-allauth` and `django-crispy-forms`.
