This is DoorToDoor App
we will build Delivery Application using Python 3 and Django  

There will be three sides to this application and users must be connected to use it:  

* 1- Customer can add, modify or delete product and view his Dashboard  
* 2- Delivery man views today's product and modify status "doing", "done", "return"  
* 3- Admin can use like a customer or delivery man, have all dashboard and manage  
* 4- Employe can view all dashboard

## Demo
View the application at [Door To Door App](http://104.236.104.196/)

## 1.Python environment

The environement setup process depends on your system. Do some research to find out how to do it on OS.  
For MAC you can use the following commands  
```
pip install virtualenv
```

Create virtual environment
```
python -m virtualenv myenv
```
Active this env

```
Mac: source myenv/bin/activate
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate.bat

```

## 2.Clone repositorie
Clone the repo and move to the project folder
```
git clone *repo_url*
cd dkrexpress

```

## 3.Install Packages
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## 4.Apply database migrations
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## 5.Run the app
Letâ€™s start the development server and explore it.

```
python manage.py runserver

```
The api should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/


## 6.Manage Users
* Create an admin user  
First weâ€™ll need to create a user who can login to the admin site. Run the following command:  

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
If the server is not running start it again by running:  
```
python manage.py runserver
```
***
Now, open a Web browser and go to admin on your local domain   
ðŸš¨ check `dkrexpress/dkrexpress/urls.py` to know URL of `admin.site.urls`  
You should see the adminâ€™s login screen:

***
Now, try logging in with the superuser account you created in the previous step  
You should see the Django admin index page:

***
Users must be connected to use the app so tests need to have data: users with groups  
* Create Groups:  
Must have 4 groups:  
Groups Name | Description  
------------| -----------  
`Admin`     | Can use like Clients or Livreurs account,have all dashboard and manage them    
`Clients`   | Add, modify or delete product and view his Dashboard                            
`Employes`  | View all dashboard                                                            
`Livreurs`  | View today's product and modify status "doing", "done", "return"   
 
* Create Users:  
4 users mustt be create and associate it a group  
The groups this user belongs to. A user will get all permissions granted to each of their groups.  
Run tthe App again [like this](#5.Run-the-app) and Connect with users created

## 6. Troubleshooting 

If there is any problem during the installation of the python package, just install each them one by one using   
```
pip install *package_name*. 
```
The most important packages are `django`, `django-allauth` and `django-crispy-forms`.
